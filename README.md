# Debugging and Comments Assignment

## Problem Description
Write a program that prompts the user for their name and grade (in that order).
Then print a response that reads "Hello (name)! I can't wait to be in (grade) too!" where 
* Note: (name) and (grade) are the values the user entered.

Use comments to make notes about errors you encountered and edits you made.
If you did it perfectly the first time, cause some errors intentionally and then add comments about fixing them.

## Example
```
Name: Anna
Grade: 10th

Output: Hello Anna! I can't wait to be in 10th grade too!
```

## Suggested Approach
1. Be careful to direct the user and choose your print statement carefully. For example, if the user enters `10` and you expected `10th`, the response will refer to `10 grade` which doesn't make sense. How you format it is up to you as long as it works, both grammatically and programmatically. You can avoid issues by including formatting directions in your input prompt. 
2. There is no test code for this assignment. Run youor program a few times to be sure you are satisfied, then commit and push.
