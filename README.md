# Debugging and Comments Assignment

## Problem Description
Write a program that prompts the user for their name and grade (in that order).
Then print a response that reads "Hello (name)! I can't wait to be in (grade) too!" where 
* Note: (name) and (grade) are the values the user entered.

Use comments to make notes about errors you encountered and edits you made.
If you did it perfectly the first time, cause some errors intentionally and then add comments about fixing them.
Turn in on GitHub and add a screenshot to your portfolio!

## Example
```
Name: Anna
Grade: 10

Output: Hello Anna! I can't wait to be in 10th grade too!
```

## Suggested Approach
1. Be careful to format your print statement carefully, so the format of the output matches the format above.
2. Run your program a few times to be sure you are satisfied, then commit and push. Then, check the feedback in the Pull Requests on GitHub. Be sure you pass both the accuracy and the style tests.
